# tabula_rasa
A blank slate or template to initialize data science projects.

#### Project Initialization

1. Clone tabula_rasa `git clone https://github.com/edwardcjohnson/tabula_rasa.git`
2. Rename tabula_rasa to reflect the project name you want e.g. `mv tabula_rasa/ cool_ds_project/`
3. Customize the default environment.yml for your project
   * At a minimum you should change the name to reflect your project's name e.g. `name: cool_ds_project`
   * More details on creating your environment are in the section below
4. Create the conda environment with `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
5. If you'd like to create a github repo for this project refer to the section below. 

#### Python Environment Creation
This is based off of [tdhopper.com's environment workflow](http://tdhopper.com/blog/2015/Nov/24/my-python-environment-workflow-with-conda/) and [conda.io's managing environments](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html) 

1. Create an environment.yml file in the directory. 
   * The environment name should be the same as the folder name.
   * At a minimum, it will specify the version of Python I want to use; it will often include anaconda as a dependency.
   * If you want to save your current environment instead of creating a new one, enter `conda env export > environment.yml`
   * If you want to create an environment without using environment.yml, enter `conda create --name project_name python=3.6`
2. Create the conda environment with `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
3. Activate the conda environment with `source activate ENV_NAME`.
4. Create a .env file containing the line `source activate ENV_NAME`.
   * autoenv should be installed, so that this file will be run every time I navigate to the project folder in the Terminal.
   * Therefore, my conda environment will be activated as soon as I navigate to the folder.

#### Create A Github Repository

1. Run `git init` to make the folder a Git repository. 
   * Then run `git add environment.yml` and `git commit -m 'initial commit'` to add the YAML file to the repository.
2. If I want to push the repository to Github, I use `git create` using Github's hub commands.
   * I then push the master branch with `git push -u origin master`.
